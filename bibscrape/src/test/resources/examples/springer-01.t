  abstract = {The sun navigation hypothesis of\textsc{Matthews} is briefly reviewed with special reference to his sun occlusion experiment which supports this hypothesis. The results of a similar experiment are presented in which 13 young pigeons were kept from sight of the sun during a seven day period including the fall equinox while the sun height at noon decreased 3{\textdegree} 6.7{\ensuremath{^{\prime}}}. When the birds were released from a point 93 km. south of their loft they were exposed to a noon sun height equal to that of a point north of their home loft eight days earlier. Nevertheless they showed a northward orientation as did the 10 control birds with no difference in homing performance between the experimental and control groups. These results are not in agreement with those of\textsc{Matthews} and do not support his sun navigation hypothesis.},
