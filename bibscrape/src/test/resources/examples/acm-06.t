  abstract = {In this paper we investigate, in the context of \textit{functional prototype-based languages}, objects which might extend themselves upon receiving a message. The possibility for an object of extending its own {\textquotedbl}self{\textquotedbl}, referred to by Cardelli, as a \textit{self-inflicted} operation, is novel in the context of typed object-based languages. We present a sound type system for this calculus which guarantees that evaluating a well-typed expression will never yield a message-not-found run-time error. We give several examples which illustrate the increased expressive power of our system with respect to existing calculi of objects. The new type system allows also for a flexible \textit{width-subtyping}, still permitting sound method override, and a limited form of object extension. The resulting calculus appears to be a good starting point for a rigorous mathematical analysis of class-based languages.},
