  abstract = {A graph reachability query, as one of the primary tasks in numerous applications, is to find whether two given data objects, u and v, are related in any way in a large and complex dataset. Formally, the query is about to find if v is reachable from u in a directed graph which is large in size. In this paper, we focus ourselves on building a reachability labeling for large directed graphs, in order to process reachability queries efficiently. A new approach is proposed to compress transitive closure to support reachability checkings. The approach consists of two schemes, called Core-I labeling and Core-II labeling, respectively. For a graph G with n nodes and e edges, the labeling time of Core-I is bounded by O(n + e + t},
