  abstract = {Low-level program analysis is a fundamental problem, taking the shape of {\textquotedbl}flow analysis{\textquotedbl} in functional languages and {\textquotedbl}points-to{\textquotedbl} analysis in imperative and object-oriented languages. Despite the similarities, the vocabulary and results in the two communities remain largely distinct, with limited cross-understanding. One of the few links is Shivers's \textit{k}-CFA work, which has advanced the concept of {\textquotedbl}context-sensitive analysis{\textquotedbl} and is widely known in both communities.
{\par}
Recent results indicate that the relationship between the functional and object-oriented incarnations of \textit{k}-CFA is not as well understood as thought. Van Horn and Mairson proved \textit{k}-CFA for \textit{k} {\ensuremath{\geq}} 1 to be EXPTIME-complete; hence, no polynomial-time algorithm can exist. Yet, there are several polynomial-time formulations of context-sensitive points-to analyses in object-oriented languages. Thus, it seems that functional \textit{k}-CFA may actually be a profoundly different analysis from object-oriented \textit{k}-CFA. We resolve this paradox by showing that the exact same specification of \textit{k}-CFA is polynomial-time for object-oriented languages yet exponential-time for functional ones: objects and closures are subtly different, in a way that interacts crucially with context-sensitivity and complexity. This illumination leads to an immediate payoff: by projecting the object-oriented treatment of objects onto closures, we derive a polynomial-time hierarchy of context-sensitive CFAs for functional programs.},
