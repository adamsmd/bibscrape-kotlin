  abstract = {In this paper, we prove that a plane graph of maximum degree \ensuremath{{\Delta}{\ensuremath{\geqslant}}6} is \ensuremath{({\Delta}+1)}-totally-colorable if it contains neither chordal 5-cycle nor chordal 6-cycle. This further extends the known class of plane graphs of maximum degree \emph{{\textgreek{D}}} in which every graph is \ensuremath{({\Delta}+1)}-totally-colorable.},
