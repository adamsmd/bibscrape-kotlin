  abstract = {We present the \emph{dynamically typed} {\textgreek{l}}-calculus, an extension of the statically typed {\textgreek{l}}-calculus with a special type Dyn and explicit \emph{dynamic type coercions} corresponding to run-time type tagging and type check-and-untag operations. Programs in run-time typed languages can be interpreted in the dynamically typed {\textgreek{l}}-calculus via a nondeterministic \emph{completion process} that inserts explicit coercions and type declarations such that a well-typed term results.
{\par}
We characterize when two different completions of the same run-time typed program are \emph{coherent} with an equational theory that is independent of an underlying {\textgreek{l}}-theory. This theory is refined by orienting some equations to define \emph{safety} and \emph{minimality} of completions. Intuitively, a safe completion is one that does not produce an error at run-time which another completion would have avoided, and a minimal completion is a safe completion that executes fewest tagging and check-and-untag operations amongst all safe completions.
{\par}
We show that every untyped {\textgreek{l}}-term has a safe completion at any type and that it is unique modulo a suitable congruence relation. Furthermore, we present a rewriting system for generating minimal completions. Assuming strong normalization of this rewriting system we show that every {\textgreek{l}}\emph{I}-term has a minimal completion at any type, which is furthermore unique modulo equality in the dynamically typed {\textgreek{l}}-calculus.},
