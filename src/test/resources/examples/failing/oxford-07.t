  abstract = {This paper presents an aspect-oriented calculus for security called {\textgreek{l}}{\_}SAOP. It is based on the {\textgreek{l}}{\_}calculus and contains pointcuts that are relevant to security hardening of applications. The main contribution of the paper is a semantics for {\textgreek{l}}{\_}SAOP advice weaving in the presence of these pointcuts. We instrument the effect-based type inference system to inject advices into expressions during static typing. The proposed semantics for advice weaving is in the spirit of AspectJ, a prominent aspect-oriented programming language, where advices are injected before, after or around the join points that match their respective pointcuts. For this purpose, we accommodate the effect-based inference algorithm to take matching and weaving processes into consideration. In addition, we establish the required soundness and preservation proofs.},
