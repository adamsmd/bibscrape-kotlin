  abstract = {Traditional flow analysis techniques, such as the ones typically employed by optimizing Fortran compilers, do not work for Scheme-like languages. This paper presents a flow analysis technique {---} \textit{control flow analysis} {---} which is applicable to Scheme-like languages. As a demonstration application, the information gathered by control flow analysis is used to perform a traditional flow analysis problem, induction variable elimination. Extensions and limitations are discussed.
{\par}
The techniques presented in this paper are backed up by working code. They are applicable not only to Scheme, but also to related languages, such as Common Lisp and ML.},
