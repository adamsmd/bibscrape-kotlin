  abstract = {The effectiveness of an inlining algorithm is determined not only by its ability to recognize inlining opportunities but also by its discretion in exercising those opportunities. This paper presents a new inlining algorithm for higher-order languages that combines simple analysis techniques with demand-driven online transformation to achieve consistent and often dramatic performance gains in fast linear time. The algorithm is shown to be as effective as and significantly faster than offline, analysis-intensive algorithms recently described in the literature.},
