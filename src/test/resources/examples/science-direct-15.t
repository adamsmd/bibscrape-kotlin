  abstract = {In this paper, we present \textsc{Aspic}, an automatic polyhedral invariant generation tool for flowcharts programs. \textsc{Aspic} implements an improved Linear Relation Analysis on numeric counter automata. The {\textquotedblleft}accelerated{\textquotedblright} method improves precision by computing locally a precise overapproximation of a loop without using the widening operator. \texttt{c2fsm} is a C preprocessor that generates automata in the format required by \textsc{Aspic}. The experimental results show the performance and precision of the tools.},
