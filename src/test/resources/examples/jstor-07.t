  abstract = {Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) increases CD4$^+$ cell numbers, but its ability to correct the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced immune deficiency remains unknown. A three-phase T cell reconstitution was demonstrated after HAART, with: (i) an early rise of memory CD4$^+$ cells, (ii) a reduction in T cell activation correlated to the decreasing retroviral activity together with an improved CD4$^+$ T cell reactivity to recall antigens, and (iii) a late rise of {\textquotedbl}na{\"{\i}}ve{\textquotedbl} CD4$^+$ lymphocytes while CD8$^+$ T cells declined, however, without complete normalization of these parameters. Thus, decreasing the HIV load can reverse HIV-driven activation and CD4$^+$ T cell defects in advanced HIV-infected patients.},
