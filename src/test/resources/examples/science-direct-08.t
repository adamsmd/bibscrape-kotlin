  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the complexity of query containment problem for tree patterns (which express a fragment of XPath) with arbitrary arithmetic comparisons. We assume that attributes take values from a totally ordered domain and allow constraints that involve arithmetic comparisons. We show that the containment problem is \ensuremath{{\Pi}_{2}^{P}}-complete in the general case, but remains co-NP complete for tree patterns with left semi-interval ({\textless}, {\ensuremath{\leqslant}}, =) or right semi-interval ({\textgreater}, {\ensuremath{\geqslant}}, =) attribute constraints.},
