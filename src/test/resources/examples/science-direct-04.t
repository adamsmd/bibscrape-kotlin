  abstract = {We consider the \emph{vertex cover} \ensuremath{{P}_{n}} (\ensuremath{{VCP}_{n}}) problem, that is, the problem of finding a minimum weight set \ensuremath{F{\ensuremath{\subset}}V} such that the graph \ensuremath{G[V{\ensuremath{-}}F]} has no \ensuremath{{P}_{n}}, where \ensuremath{{P}_{n}} is a path with \emph{n} vertices. The problem also has its application background. In this paper, we restrict our attention to the \ensuremath{{VCP}_{3}} problem and give a 2-approximation algorithm using the technique of layering.},
