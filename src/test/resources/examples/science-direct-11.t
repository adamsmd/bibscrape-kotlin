  abstract = {A top-down parsing scheme for macro grammars is proposed. It extends the recursive descent method frequently used in context-free parsing. It is shown to be decidable if a macro grammar is top-down parsable. Nearly matching lower and upper bounds for the complexity of the decision procedure are derived. A time and space efficient recognition algorithm is described.},
