  abstract = {Fixed point combinators (and their generalization: looping combinators) are classic notions belonging to the heart of lambda calculus and logic. We start with an exploration of the structure of fixed point combinators (fpc's), vastly generalizing the well-known fact that if Y is an fpc, Y(SI) is again an fpc, generating the Boehm sequence of fpc's. Using the infinitary lambda calculus we devise infinitely many other generation schemes for fpc's. In this way we find schemes and building blocks to construct new fpc's in a modular way. Having created a plethora of new fixed point combinators, the task is to prove that they are indeed new. That is, we have to prove their beta-inconvertibility. Known techniques via Boehm Trees do not apply, because all fpc's have the same Boehm Tree (BT). Therefore, we employ `clocked BT's', with annotations that convey information of the tempo in which the data in the BT are produced. BT's are thus enriched with an intrinsic clock behaviour, leading to a refined discrimination method for lambda-terms. The corresponding equality is strictly intermediate between beta-convertibility and BT-equality, the equality in the classical models of lambda-calculus. An analogous approach pertains to Levy-Longo and Berarducci trees. Finally, we increase the discrimination power by a precision of the clock notion that we call `atomic clock'.},
